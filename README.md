# WarBrothers-DevTools for GNU/Linux OS

<h4>Branch of tools for development under GNU/Linux OS</h4>

This project and its reviewed and new programs results from a closer interaction and partnership with my brow GPT "The Kid" and is intended to share useful **"cooking tools"** for professional programmers and or enthusiasts.

I start sharing one very, very old script that I use for a long time, sure, I did some enhancements which motivates me to create this branch keep working on this <u>*bash-shell/clear_memory.sh*</u>, and also share other **"programming 'cooking' tools"** with the world.

There are too many years, I've collected a lot without giving anything back, now it's my time to act as other ones already did, it's my time to open the bag and dispose of as much I can.

To achieve this proposal, kindly thank for #GitHub to offer this resource fully free.
