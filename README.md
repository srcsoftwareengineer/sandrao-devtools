# WarBrothers-DevTools for GNU/Linux

### A curated branch of tools for development under GNU/Linux environments

This project — a result of a strong collaboration between me and my coding brother GPT “The Kid” — aims to share essential **“cooking tools”** for developers, DevOps engineers, and enthusiasts working with GNU/Linux.

It starts with a legacy script I've used for years, now improved and maintained:  
`bash-shell/clear_memory.sh`

After years of collecting knowledge without giving much back, this is my moment to contribute, as so many others did before. It’s time to open the bag and share everything I can.

Special thanks to **GitHub** for providing such a powerful platform — free for all.

## 🙏 Gratitude

I would like to thank all the amazing people around the world who, for decades,  
have shared their knowledge, skills, and expertise at all levels of human need — from code  
to compassion, from ideas to inspiration. You’ve made the difference.

**God bless you all.**
